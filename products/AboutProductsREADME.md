# sims_Provenance products
This folder contains information about procedures, software and data inputs
used to produce each data product.   Information which is not specific to
a particular run, such as description of procedures, should go in a README
in the top-level directory for that product.  Per-run information, such
as software or data input versions, should go in a subdirectory named
after the run.
